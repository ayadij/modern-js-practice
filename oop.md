# OOP
Object Oriented Programming

js is not originally OOP

imagine a blueprint of a house... it is not technically a house.. it just defines how it should funcion
a class is like a blueprint... it is a list of definitions that describe what it is supposed to do and how it should behave

INSTANTIATION: take a blueprint and create a realworld object with it
ex: User Class it is a blueprint for User. defines how a User should behave. --Instantiation is creating an instance of a User object. 

instantiation: a class by itself does nothing. so you must create a instantiation. it is a funciton inside of a class.
